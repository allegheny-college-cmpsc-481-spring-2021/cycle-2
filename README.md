### Progress report (`progress.md`)

This report must meet the following criteria:

- [ ] At least 500 words
- [ ] Completed using proper document structure in Markdown
- [ ] Includes a link to the open issue thread which the team is tackling
- [ ] Includes a `Personnel` section, listing the members of your group and roles they play for the Cycle
- [ ] Includes a `Summary` section, summarizing the project and issue selected
- [ ] Includes a `Tasks` section featuring sub-sections for each role's completed and outstanding tasks
- [ ] Includes a `Progress` section which estimates feasibility of achieving deadline and provides a general discussion of Cycle progress and challenges
- [ ] At least one paragraph for each of the `Summary`, `Tasks`, and `Progress` sections

### Final Technical Report (`FTR.md`)

This report must meet the following criteria:

- [ ] At least 1000 words
- [ ] Completed using proper document structure in Markdown
- [ ] Includes a link to the Pull Request made
- [ ] Includes a `Personnel` section, listing the members of your group and roles they play for the Cycle
- [ ] Includes a `Summary` section, summarizing the project and issue selected, including a technical description of moderate depth
- [ ] Includes an `Evaluation` section, summarizing the overall success of the project
- [ ] Includes a `Testing` section which describes how the group tested their contribution
- [ ] Includes a `Post Mortem` section in which the team reflects on process improvements or repeatable successes to take forward from the Cycle
- [ ] At least one paragraph for each of the `Summary`, `Evaluation`, `Testing`, and `Post Mortem` sections

## Evaluation

The points you earn for each Cycle come from a combination of:

* Issuance of a Pull Request (or similar) for a feature of non-trivial complexity
* The quality of your group's in-process and final documentation
* The overall quality of your interaction with and contribution to your chosen project
* Comments from peers and external reviewers using feedback forms

## Turning in the assignment

### Writing

All reports should be turned in using Markdown files extant in the `writing` directory of this repository. As stipulated in the Syllabus [in the course-materials repository](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-481-spring-2021/course-materials), the writer should spearhead the effort. However, this does not mean that they alone should complete it. These reports require input and contribution from the entire group.

### Surveys

This survey will be distributed to you via our course's [Slack channel](http://cmpsc-481-sp-2021.slack.com) as we near the end of the Cycle.
